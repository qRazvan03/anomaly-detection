Hello, this rep is made for my laboratory work (Anomaly Detection) which is directly attributed to my master's degree Security and Applied Logic at University of Bucharest.
For each laboratory I will add a new branch to the tree of this repository or I will add in to the main branch.
Name: Petrosanu Florentin-Razvan

For the first lab exercises: https://github.com/qRazvan03/anomaly-detection/tree/lab1ad
